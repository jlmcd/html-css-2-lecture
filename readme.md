# HTML & CSS Day 2 Lecture Notes

## Branches

There are two branches to show students in this repo!

1. `Master` has a landing page built with semantic HTML tags.
2. `divs` has the same landing page built with only divs.

I typically show students the webpage built with only divs first, and the code associated with it. Then I show them how semantic tags can clean things up and provide clarity in the code.
